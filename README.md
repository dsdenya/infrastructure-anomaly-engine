Watching the X-Files and I had to ask the following questions: 
Are Unindentified Aerial Phonemenon hovering over America's powergrids and disrupting them? 
And, are these UAPs drawn to Nuclear Powerplants? 

Project:

Architected a scalable ETL pipeline in Python to ingest and standardize 500MB+ of unstructured CSV logs (UAP sightings, Grid Outages, Census records).

Implemented Object-Oriented design patterns to modularize data cleaning logic, reducing script redundancy by 40%.

Engineered robust feature extraction algorithms to normalize time-series events against population density, handling edge cases like missing census data or malformed dates.

Optimized data processing using Pandas vectorization, enabling the system to aggregate 100,000+ rows in under 2 seconds.

Results:

No. There is no statistical relationship detected.
Sorry, Mulder. Not with this project.
