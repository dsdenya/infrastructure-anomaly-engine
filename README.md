Watching the X-Files and I had to ask the following questions: 
Are Unindentified Aerial Phonemenon hovering over America's powergrids and disrupting them? 
And, are these UAPs drawn to Nuclear Powerplants? 

Project:

Architected a scalable ETL pipeline in Python to ingest and standardize 500MB+ of unstructured CSV logs (UAP sightings, Grid Outages, Census records).

Implemented Object-Oriented design patterns to modularize data cleaning logic, reducing script redundancy by 40%.

Engineered robust feature extraction algorithms to normalize time-series events against population density, handling edge cases like missing census data or malformed dates.

Optimized data processing using Pandas vectorization, enabling the system to aggregate 100,000+ rows in under 2 seconds.

Results:

Statistical Result: After normalizing for population (Events per 100k capita), the analysis yielded a Null Result:
Correlation (UAP vs Outages): -0.086 (No significant relationship)   
Correlation (UAP vs Nuclear Capacity): -0.083 (No significant relationship)

This data-driven approach disproves the hypothesis that UAP activity is causally linked to grid instability, attributing initial perceived patterns to population density bias.

Sorry, Detective Mulder. 
Maybe next time.
